/**
 * Cross-browser collection of unhandled errors
 *
 * Supports:
 * - Firefox: full stack trace with line numbers, plus column number
 * on top frame; column number is not guaranteed
 * - Opera: full stack trace with line and column numbers
 * - Chrome: full stack trace with line and column numbers
 * - Safari: line and column number for the top frame only; some frames
 * may be missing, and column number is not guaranteed
 * - IE: line and column number for the top frame only; some frames
 * may be missing, and column number is not guaranteed
 *
 * In theory, TraceKit should work on all of the following versions:
 * - IE5.5+ (only 8.0 tested)
 * - Firefox 0.9+ (only 3.5+ tested)
 * - Opera 7+ (only 10.50 tested; versions 9 and earlier may require
 * Exceptions Have Stacktrace to be enabled in opera:config)
 * - Safari 3+ (only 4+ tested)
 * - Chrome 1+ (only 5+ tested)
 * - Konqueror 3.5+ (untested)
 *
 * Tries to catch all unhandled errors and report them to the
 * callback.
 *
 * Callbacks receive a StackTrace object as described in the
 * computeStackTrace docs.
